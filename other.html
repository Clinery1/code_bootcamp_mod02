                    My Resume is a beautiful 8.5x11" page displayed inside of a website located
                    <a href="https://clinery1.github.io/resume/resume-sanitized.html">here</a>.
                    It can be easily printed from the aforementioned website if required.
                    I also used Docbuilder, my document creation tool, so this gives credit to that
                    project since it produced a good looking, valid document.

                <p>
                    Docbuilder is an easy way to build good looking documents. It features a simple
                    layout system of vertical and horizontal sections that can be nested as much as
                    desired. Although Docbuilder is in Alpha, it can still build readable documents.
                    A rewrite for Docbuilder is planned, but has no completion date. Before the
                    rewrite, Docbuilder is very limited. The rewrite will introduce a new s-expression
                    based syntax that feels intuitive and is easy to write instead of the clunky
                    markdown hybrid that the public build currently uses.

                    Every Linux user has dotfiles, so why not share them for others to see? Mine are
                    located in <a href="https://github.com/Clinery1/dotfiles">Clinery1/dotfiles</a>.
                    My NeoVim, Fish, Sway, Waybar, Fusuma, and Alacritty dotfiles are included.

                <p>
                    Since I spend a lot of time in the shell, why not make it as easy as possible?
                    My fish prompt solves a lot of the problems that a normal prompt has:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Few/no colors</li>
                    <li>No file list</li>
                    <li>No time</li>
                    <li>Doesn't show the exit status of piped commands</li>
                    <li>Doesn't look cool</li>
                    <li>Doesn't show info about Git</li>
                    <li>Isn't made by me</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The source for my prompt is located in
                    <a href="https://github.com/Clinery1/fish_prompt">Clinery1/fish_prompt</a>.
                    The project was recently refactored, so it is much more readable and easy to extend
                    than before.
